const toolsUsage = `abctl tools scan — derive a tool-prune remove list from local transcripts

Usage:
  abctl tools scan [--days N | --all] [--keep Name,Name] [--dir PATH] [--write CONFIG]

Flags:
  --days N        window in days to consider a tool "used" (default 30)
  --all           no window: every tool call in every transcript counts
  --keep LIST     comma-separated tool names to withhold from the candidate list
  --dir PATH      transcript directory (default ~/.claude/projects)
  --write CONFIG  patch the remove: list of the tool-prune entry in CONFIG in
                  place; without it, the YAML block is printed for you to paste

Transcripts record tools that were called, never tools that were offered, so a
name abctl does not recognise is never proposed for removal.
`

// runTools handles the `tools` subcommand. Returns the process exit code.
// thinEvidenceTools is the number of distinct called tools below which the scan
// warns that its proposal is aggressive. Chosen as a smell test, not a
// threshold with meaning: a real session touches Read/Edit/Bash and more within
// minutes, so fewer than this says "barely any history" rather than "these are
// the tools I use".
