Usage:
  abctl service install   [--yes] [--config PATH]
  abctl service uninstall [--yes]
  abctl service status
  abctl service stop | start | restart

install hands the proxy to the OS supervisor — a launchd user agent on macOS, a
systemd user unit on Linux — so it restarts on failure and comes back at login.
Claude Code depends on the proxy being up once "abctl claude-code enable" has run,
and nothing else keeps it up.

stop/start/restart exist so there is never a reason to reach for launchctl,
systemctl, kill or pkill: under a supervisor a plain kill is undone within seconds,
which looks like the process refusing to die.

If a proxy you started by hand is already running, install stops it first and
supervises a fresh one: two copies cannot share the ports, and the supervised one
would otherwise crash-loop while the old one kept serving — broken in a way that
only shows up at your next reboot.

Never installed as root. The proxy holds a CA private key; this stays a user
service.
