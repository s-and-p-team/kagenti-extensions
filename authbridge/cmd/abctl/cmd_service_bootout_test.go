// TestWaitBootedOut_RealLaunchd drives real launchctl against a throwaway label,
// reproducing the failure a real upgrade hit: `launchctl bootout` returns while
// teardown is still in progress, and bootstrapping into that window fails with
// "Bootstrap failed: 5: Input/output error". Our own teardown is slow — the supervisor
// forwards SIGTERM and waits out the proxy's graceful shutdown — so the window is wide
// enough to lose. A trivial job dies fast enough to hide it, which is why every test
// starting from nothing, or running uninstall first, passed.
// TestBootoutWaitIsWiredIn pins the CALL SITE, not just the helper.
//
// Verified by mutation: deleting the waitBootedOut call from loadService left this
// entire suite green — the same shape of gap that let the EIO bug ship. Reading the
// source is the idiom already used by TestStopIsDurable, and unlike the launchd test
// below it runs on Linux CI.
