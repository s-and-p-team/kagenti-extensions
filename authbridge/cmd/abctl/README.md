# abctl

Interactive terminal UI for inspecting AuthBridge's in-memory session store.
`abctl` connects to the session API exposed by an AuthBridge sidecar
(default `http://localhost:9094`, typically reached via `kubectl port-forward`)
and lets you browse active sessions, follow a session's event stream live,
and read individual events as pretty-printed JSON.

```

## Install

Download a prebuilt `abctl` for your platform (linux/macOS, amd64/arm64) from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/rossoctl/cortex/releases) — see
[Download prebuilt binaries](../../README.md#download-prebuilt-binaries) for the download,
checksum-verify, and macOS quarantine steps — and drop it on your PATH.

Or build from source:

```sh
cd authbridge/cmd/abctl
go build .
```

Either way you get a single binary (~10 MB; the linux build is fully static).

## Run

`abctl` discovers AuthBridge agents in your current `kubectl` context
and lets you pick one:

```sh
./abctl
```

You'll see a Namespaces pane listing each namespace that contains an
AuthBridge agent. Enter drills into the Pods pane for that namespace;
Enter on a pod starts a `kubectl port-forward` automatically and drops
you into the session-events view. Esc backs out. `q` (or Ctrl+C) quits
and tears the port-forward down.

The picker shells out to `kubectl` — whatever context you're in is the
context abctl uses. There's no separate auth.

### Connecting to an existing port-forward

Press `l` on the Namespaces pane to skip the cluster entirely and
connect straight to `http://localhost:9094` — the session API's default
port on the local host. Useful when you already have your own
`kubectl port-forward` running, when abctl runs inside the mesh, or when
your kubeconfig can't list pods but a tunnel is up.

abctl probes `/v1/sessions` before switching panes, so an endpoint with
nothing listening surfaces as a footer error and leaves you in the
picker rather than dropping you into a silently empty session view.
`Esc` from a session entered this way returns to the Namespaces pane
(there's no pod to go back to). Pipeline editing (`e`) is unavailable,
same as `--endpoint` mode: the cluster fields needed to fetch and apply
the ConfigMap aren't populated.

### Power-user / scripting bypass

Pass `--endpoint` to skip the picker entirely:

```sh
kubectl port-forward -n team1 pod/weather-agent-xxxx 9094:9094 &
./abctl --endpoint http://localhost:9094
```

This preserves the pre-picker behavior for scripts, CI, or remote
session APIs that aren't in your kube context.

## Panes

The UI has these top-level panes. `Enter` drills in; `Esc` backs out.

- **Sessions** (default): table of active sessions in the store, most
  recently updated first. Columns: ID, updated (relative), event count,
  active marker.
- **Events**: per-session event table. Columns: time, direction (in/out),
  phase (req/resp), protocol (a2a/mcp/inf), method or model, HTTP status,
  duration, host. Live-updates while in view — if the cursor is on the
  last row, it auto-follows new events.
- **Detail**: pretty-printed JSON of a single event. Scroll with arrow
  keys; `y` yanks to `/tmp/abctl-event-<timestamp>.json` and flashes the
  path in the footer.
- **Pipeline**: the active plugin chain in inbound + outbound order.
  Columns: position, direction, plugin name, DEPS (✓/✗ — see "Plugin
  dependencies" below), writes, body access, event count. `e` opens
  the editor.
- **Plugin detail**: drill-into-row for Pipeline or Catalog. Shows
  description, position, reads/writes, body access, plugin config, and
  per-dependency satisfaction status against the active chain.
- **Catalog**: registered-plugin browser, opened by `P` from any
  session-view pane. Lists every plugin the running binary knows how to
  construct, including ones not in the active pipeline. Useful for
  discovering what's available before adding to the pipeline. Sourced
  from `/v1/plugins`.

Layered on top of all of them:

- **Key help**: a modal overlay listing every keybinding, opened by `?`
  from anywhere (picker included). The current pane's bindings come
  first and are highlighted; the global keys and a one-line summary of
  every other pane follow. While it's up it owns the keyboard — `?`,
  `Esc`, or `q` closes it (`q` closes the overlay rather than quitting
  abctl). This is the discoverable home for keys the single-line footer
  has no room for, `P` among them. Two exceptions: while a pipeline edit
  is in flight that overlay is already modal and owns `y`/`N`, and while
  the filter input is focused `?` is a character you're typing (session
  IDs and hosts can contain one). In both cases `?` is inert until the
  keyboard is released.

  The body scrolls, so the full reference is reachable on a short
  terminal: `↑↓`/`jk` by line, `b`/`f` or PgUp/PgDn by page, `u`/`d` by
  half page, `g`/`G` to the ends. A `[↑↓] scroll  <n>%` affordance
  appears in the overlay's footer only when the content overflows; the
  close hint stays pinned there at every scroll position. Resizing the
  terminal re-ranges the body without losing your place.

## Keybindings

| Key | Context | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `?` | any (not while filtering or mid-edit) | open the key-help overlay (`?`/`Esc`/`q` closes) |
| `↑ ↓` / `k j`, `b`/`f`, `u`/`d`, `g`/`G` | key help | scroll the overlay |
| `↑ ↓` / `k j` | picker, list | navigate rows |
| `Enter` | namespaces | open the namespace |
| `l` | namespaces | connect directly to `localhost:9094` |
| `Enter` | pods | port-forward + connect |
| `Esc` | pods | back to namespaces |
| `r` | namespaces, pods | reload agent list from cluster |
| `Enter` / `→` / `l` | sessions, events | drill into selection |
| `Esc` / `←` / `h` | detail, events | back out |
| `Esc` | sessions, pipeline | (picker mode) tear down port-forward and back to pods |
| `/` | sessions, events | filter (substring match; Enter commits, Esc cancels) |
| `s` | events | toggle skip-row visibility (default: hidden; the events footer shows the hidden count) |
| `p` | any | pause/resume stream |
| `y` | detail | yank event JSON to `/tmp` |
| `g` / `G` | lists | jump to top / bottom |
| `P` | any session-view pane (not the picker) | open the registered-plugin catalog |
| `r` | catalog | refresh the catalog from `/v1/plugins` |
| `e` | pipeline | edit pipeline subtree in `$EDITOR` |
| `y` | edit/diff | apply the edit |
| `N` | edit/diff | abort the edit |
| `r` | edit/error | retry: re-open the editor (post-edit failure) or refetch (fetch failure) |
| `Esc` | edit/{fetching,editing,applying} | abort the edit, return to Pipeline pane |
| `Esc` | edit/{waiting,rollback} | background the watch; result lands as a footer flash |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | any | quit (closes the key-help overlay first, if open) |

## Editing the pipeline

Press `e` on the Pipeline pane to edit the agent's runtime `pipeline:`
subtree in `$EDITOR` (or `vi` if unset). On save, abctl shows a diff
and asks `apply this change? (y/N)`. Confirming runs
`kubectl apply --server-side` against the per-agent ConfigMap with
`--field-manager=abctl --force-conflicts=true` (taking ownership of
`data.config.yaml` from the operator's webhook on first
edit), then polls the framework's `/reload/status` until the reload
completes (success or failure).

The single edit flow covers four operations:
- **Edit a value** — change a config field of an existing plugin
- **Reorder** — move a plugin's lines up or down
- **Remove** — delete a plugin's entry from `inbound:` or `outbound:`
- **Add** — append a new plugin entry

All four work because they're all just lines you change inside the
pipeline subtree.

`e` is only available in picker mode. With `--endpoint`, the cluster
fields needed to fetch and apply aren't populated; pressing `e`
flashes a hint instead of opening a broken edit.

### Pre-apply validation

After save, abctl runs the same Requires/RequiresAny/After/Claims
checks the framework runs at reload-time, against the cached
`/v1/plugins` catalog. Issues land as a red banner above the diff
in ~50ms instead of waiting through the kubelet sync (~60s) to
discover them at hot-reload:

```text
⚠ 1 validation issue — framework reload will reject:
  • [outbound] ibac pos 1: Requires "mcp-parser", but it is not in the outbound chain
```

The y/N prompt becomes "apply anyway? (y/N)" — abctl's check is
non-blocking. The framework's own validateRelationships is the
source of truth and will fire again at reload regardless.

Validation is silently skipped when the catalog isn't loaded
(operator hasn't pressed `P` yet). Visit the catalog pane once to
populate it for the rest of the session.

### Agent-name resolution

The per-agent ConfigMap is named `authbridge-config-<agent>`. abctl
resolves `<agent>` from the selected pod's `app.kubernetes.io/name`
label (operator sets this). If the label is absent, abctl
falls back to stripping the last two dash-separated segments of the
pod name (the ReplicaSet hash + pod suffix).

### Auto-rollback on reload failure

If `kubectl apply` succeeds but the in-pod reload fails (unknown
plugin name, malformed config, validation error), the framework
keeps the previous in-memory pipeline serving requests. The on-disk
ConfigMap, however, now holds the bad YAML. abctl detects this via
`/reload/status` and re-applies the original ConfigMap content
captured at Fetch time, reconciling the on-disk state back to what's
actually running. The error overlay then reports
`reload failed: <reason>; rolled back to previous ConfigMap`.

The rollback is best-effort — with `--force-conflicts=true`, if a
third party (controller, kubectl edit, kustomize) modified the
ConfigMap between Fetch and the failed reload, the rollback
overwrites their change. The running pipeline is unaffected.

### Backgrounding the watch

Pressing `Esc` while waiting for hot-reload (or during rollback)
moves the watch to the background instead of aborting it. The
overlay closes, the footer flashes
`hot-reload watch moved to background; you'll be notified`, and you
can resume navigating the TUI. When the watch terminates, the
result lands as a one-line flash:

- `hot-reload succeeded`
- `hot-reload failed: <reason>; rolled back to previous ConfigMap`
- `hot-reload failed: <reason>; rollback failed: <err>` (rare)

Flashes auto-dismiss after a few seconds; if you miss one, query
`/reload/status` directly via the port-forward.

### Permissions

abctl shells out to `kubectl`; kubectl uses your kubeconfig. Editing
requires `update` on `configmaps` in the agent's namespace (in
addition to `get pods` which the picker already needs). RBAC denial
surfaces verbatim in the overlay.

### Tempfile lifecycle

abctl writes the editable pipeline subtree to `$TMPDIR/abctl-pipeline-*.yaml`
on every edit. The tempfile is **left in place on every exit path**
(success, error, abort) so an interrupted edit is recoverable. On
abctl launch, files older than 24h in this glob are swept
automatically — no manual cleanup needed.

### Hot-reload window

The framework reloads via a config-file watcher; kubelet syncs
ConfigMap edits into the pod's mount within ~60s, then the framework
debounces and reloads. Total wall-clock from `apply` to reload is
typically under 90s. abctl shows a spinner during the wait.

The poller terminates with one of:

- **Success** — `/reload/status.last_success` advances past the apply
  time.
- **Failure** — `reloads_failed` increments past its baseline; the
  framework's `last_error` is shown.
- **Unreachable** — 5 consecutive transport errors against
  `:9093/reload/status` (port-forward dropped, framework crashed,
  etc.) surface as `reload status endpoint unreachable` after a few
  seconds rather than waiting the full deadline.
- **Timeout** — none of the above within 120s. Triggers an
  auto-rollback so the on-disk ConfigMap doesn't drift from the
  running pipeline.

## Plugin dependencies

Plugins declare dependencies in their `Capabilities()`:

- **Requires**: hard dependency. The named plugin MUST be in the same
  chain at a strictly-lower position; otherwise framework reload fails.
- **RequiresAny**: soft OR. At least one of the listed plugins must
  appear upstream; each one that IS present must be earlier.
- **After**: ordering hint. If the named plugin IS present, it must
  appear earlier; absent is OK.
- **Claims**: exclusive ownership. Within one chain, two plugins
  cannot both declare the same claim string.

abctl surfaces these in three places:

- **Pipeline pane DEPS column**: ✓ when all declared deps satisfied,
  ✗ when any fail, blank when no deps declared. The footer hint
  reports the count of plugins with unmet deps.
- **Plugin detail pane**: per-dependency rows with ✓/✗ and the
  satisfying upstream's position when applicable.
- **Pre-apply validation in the editor**: catches missing/misordered
  Requires before kubectl apply (~50ms vs ~60s framework roundtrip).
  See the "Pre-apply validation" subsection above.

The framework's own validateRelationships is the source of truth and
runs at every reload. abctl's checks are the fast-feedback layer.

## Trust model

`abctl` does no authentication — same as the server. Use only against
sidecars reachable via in-cluster networking or a local port-forward.
Session events contain raw user messages, LLM completions, and tool
results; treat the output accordingly.

## Architecture

- `apiclient/` — HTTP + SSE client. Sole owner of the `:9094` wire format.
  Auto-reconnects with exponential backoff (1s → 30s, capped, indefinite).
- `tui/` — Bubble Tea model/update/view. All state mutation runs on the
  Tea event loop; the SSE goroutine produces messages the loop consumes.
- `main.go` — flag parsing, signal handling, wires `tui.Run`.

## Deferred to later PRs

- Native clipboard (currently writes to `/tmp`).
- Fuzzy search beyond substring match.
- Per-user filtering (`Identity.Subject == X`).
- Krew plugin packaging.
