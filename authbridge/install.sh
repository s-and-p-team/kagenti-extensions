#
# Detects your OS/arch, downloads the prebuilt `abctl` and `authbridge-proxy`
# binaries for the newest release, verifies their SHA-256 checksums, installs
# them to ~/.local/bin, and starts Cortex in the background — then prints the
# commands to watch traffic and point an agent at it, plus how to stop it.
# macOS + Linux, amd64 + arm64. No cluster, Keycloak, or SPIRE needed.
#
# It installs, starts Cortex with its built-in config in ~/.cortex, and prints the
# command to send an agent through it. Traffic is decrypted and parsed for viewing;
# nothing is rewritten. Cutting Claude Code's token cost is one opt-in command
# afterwards, printed at the end.
#
# Options (pass through the pipe with `sh -s --`, e.g.
#   curl -fsSL ...install.sh | sh -s -- --install-only):
#
#   --install-only   install the binaries and stop
#   --claude-code    after starting, offer to write the three env vars Claude Code
#                    needs into ~/.claude/settings.json, so it runs as plain
#                    `claude`. Prompts before changing anything.
#
# There is deliberately only one config. It carries the parsers AND tool-prune,
# and the proxy preserves edits to it, so a second "cost-optimised" config had
# nothing to do that filling in one list did not already do — while costing a
# second CA, a second set of paths, and a second page of instructions that read
# identically to the first.
#
# No compatibility aliases here: this script accepted no flags at all until now,
# so there is no earlier spelling for anyone to still be using. (The proxy's
# --demo -> --local alias is different: that flag really did ship.)
#
# Flags rather than env vars: written `VAR=1 curl ... | sh` the variable reaches
# curl, not sh, so the script runs without it. `sh -s -- --flag` has no such
# failure mode. The env vars below still work.
#
# By default this script re-runs the copy from the newest RELEASE rather than
# executing whatever is currently on main — main is unstable by definition, and a
# `curl | sh` should not be the first thing to run a change nobody has released.
# --ref=main opts back in; --ref=vX.Y.Z pins.

# Environment:
#   AUTHBRIDGE_REF=REF          same as --ref

install.sh — install Cortex on a local machine (macOS/Linux, amd64/arm64).

Usage:
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rossoctl/cortex/main/authbridge/install.sh | sh
  curl -fsSL ...install.sh | sh -s -- [option]

Installs abctl and authbridge-proxy to ~/.local/bin, starts the proxy with its
built-in config in ~/.cortex, and prints the command to send an agent through it.
Traffic is decrypted and parsed for viewing; nothing is rewritten.

Options:
  --install-only   install the binaries and stop
  --claude-code    after starting, offer to configure Claude Code to use it, so
                   it runs as plain `claude` with no environment variables
  --local          the default, spelled out
  --yes, -y        do not prompt; answer yes to configuring Claude Code
  --ref=REF        take THIS SCRIPT from a git ref instead of the newest release
                   (e.g. --ref=main for unreleased changes, --ref=v0.7.0-alpha.4
                   to pin). Binaries come from the same release unless
                   AUTHBRIDGE_VERSION says otherwise.
  -h, --help       this text

Environment:
  AUTHBRIDGE_VERSION=vX.Y.Z   install a specific release tag (default: newest)
  AUTHBRIDGE_INSTALL_ONLY=1   same as --install-only
  AUTHBRIDGE_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1  use the binaries already in ~/.local/bin instead of
                              downloading (re-run setup offline)

After installing, to cut Claude Code's token cost:
  abctl tools scan --write ~/.cortex/config.yaml
