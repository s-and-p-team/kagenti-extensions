// that looks like a plugin bug: the bridge is on, the client does not trust its
// CA, so every HTTPS request opens an opaque tunnel and every body-reading
// plugin correctly does nothing. Nothing errors — the only symptom is silence.
//
// Driven through noteBridgeAttempt, not noteTunnel: the trigger is a CONNECT the
// bridge actually tried to decrypt. See TestNoteTunnel_PassthroughNeverWarns.
