# AIAC Codebase Guide

All paths below are relative to `cortex/aiac/`.

## Requirements / PRD docs

`docs/specs/PRD.md` — master PRD.
`docs/specs/components/` — per-component specs.

For current file list, `ls docs/specs/` and `ls docs/specs/components/`.

## Requirements directory — link-following policy

When a document under `docs/specs/` contains a markdown link to another file, use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask before reading it — present "Yes" and "No" as clickable options. If the user picks Yes, read the file normally. If No, treat the link as a label and continue without reading it.

## Issue tracking

Issues are tracked as **GitHub issues** on the `s-and-p-team/cortex` repo,
organized in the org-level **AIAC** Project (Projects v2):
<https://github.com/orgs/s-and-p-team/projects/1>. Use `gh` to read and manage
them.

Note: `s-and-p-team/cortex` is the AIAC team's fork of the canonical upstream
`rossoctl/cortex`. Tracking issues on the fork (not upstream) is deliberate —
PRs still target upstream, but issue tracking stays on the team fork, so the
`-R s-and-p-team/cortex` scoping below is intentional.

Hierarchy: the Project groups **Feature**-typed container issues — one per
component area, nested via GitHub **native sub-issues** to form the tree — over
**Task**-typed leaf issues. Every issue carries the `aiac` label plus cumulative
`area:<path>` labels; open issues also carry a `status:<value>` label, and the
Project's built-in **Status** field mirrors that value.

```bash
# list / view (filter to the AIAC set)
gh issue list -R s-and-p-team/cortex --label aiac --state all
gh issue view <number> -R s-and-p-team/cortex
```

## Issue tracking — codebase inspection policy

When working on an issue would benefit from inspecting the relevant source code, use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask before doing so — present "Yes" and "No" as clickable options. If the user picks Yes, inspect the codebase normally. If No, work from the issue description and existing context only.

## Handoffs

Per-task handoff documents live under `docs/handoffs/` — one markdown file per task, numeric-prefixed (e.g. `01-update-issues.md`, `02-update-source-and-tests.md`). When asked to generate a handoff, write it here (not a scratch/temp path). Each handoff must be self-contained — background, task, exact files, and acceptance criteria — so a fresh session can execute it without the originating conversation.

## Source code

`src/aiac/` — Python package root (`__init__.py` is empty). It is organized by
subsystem: an IdP configuration layer, a PDP policy-writer layer, the AIAC Agent
layer (built on the SPM/APM model — a Controller dispatching to use-case
sub-agents and a policy-rules builder), and a two-layer policy stack (models, a
model store, and the Policy Computation Engine).

Discover the concrete layout live rather than relying on a memorized tree:

```bash
find src/aiac -maxdepth 2 -type d      # subsystems and their immediate children
ls src/aiac/<subsystem>/               # drill into any layer
```

## Tests

`test/` — mirrors `src/aiac/` structure. For current file list, `ls` under `test/`.

**Unit test command:**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest test/
```

`pyproject.toml`'s `addopts` defaults `-m` to excluding every live-infra marker
(`integration`, `eval_extended`, `eval_consistency`,
`eval_robustness`, `eval_correctness_prb`), so a bare invocation never makes a real LLM/Keycloak
call. The whole `test/` tree collects and runs green — no `--ignore` flags are
needed. (This wasn't always true: the Policy Computation Engine was migrated to
the SPM store surface in Wave 3, which resolved the earlier PCE-chain collection
failures.)

The `-m "not integration"` expression needs no external services. The live-LLM
PRB suite (below) is marked **both** `integration` and `llm` — `integration`
because it calls a real LLM endpoint, so `-m "not integration"` already deselects
it (the routine collected count is unchanged by it); `llm` so it can be selected
on its own, cluster-free, via `-m llm`.

Use `ls test/` / `find test -type d` to discover current test directories.

**Live-LLM PRB tests** (`-m llm`) run the **real** LLM end-to-end through the
Policy Rules Builder (`test/agent/policy_rules_builder/test_graph_live_llm.py`)
and assert the emitted `(name, effect)` rule set matches the policy text — for
allow-only policies and for policies with explicit / description-driven /
exclusivity denies. Only the role/scope **descriptions** and the **policy
source** are mocked in-process (the `_structured_call` LLM seam is left live), so
the suite needs **no Kubernetes and no Keycloak** — only an LLM endpoint. It
reuses the same `LLM_BASE_URL` / `LLM_MODEL` / `LLM_API_KEY` env as the
integration suite and **skips cleanly** when they are unset. Run it opt-in:

```bash
set -a; . test/integration/.env; set +a   # or export LLM_BASE_URL / LLM_MODEL / LLM_API_KEY
.venv/bin/pytest test/ -m llm
```

**Integration tests** (`-m integration`) now close the **real OPA evaluation loop** — they onboard
through the in-cluster Controller, then drive real HTTP requests **through AuthBridge** and assert the
**deployed OPA plugin's** allow/deny (no `opa eval`, no `.rego` dump, so `opa` on PATH is no longer
needed). They therefore need a live **rossoctl/Kind cluster with the AuthBridge OPA pipeline wired
into both legs** (the demo `github-agent`/`github-tool` deployed + registered), plus Keycloak admin
creds and an LLM endpoint for onboarding. Stand the pipeline up with `k8s/opa-kind-enable.sh`;
the full prerequisites, wiring, and manual probe commands are in `k8s/opa-kind-runbook.md`, and the
per-loop shape is documented in `test/integration/uc1_onboard.py`. Config lives in
`test/integration/.env` (gitignored): `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`, `KEYCLOAK_URL`,
`KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Source it before running:

```bash
k8s/opa-kind-enable.sh          # one-time: wire the OPA plugin into the Kind cluster
set -a; . test/integration/.env; set +a
.venv/bin/pytest test/integration/ -m integration
```

When the cluster is not wired or the env is unset, the suite **skips cleanly** (it never false-passes).

A passed `-m` always overrides the default, so this opts back into exactly
`integration` (not the heavier markers below). Four heavier, narrower-infra
markers exist alongside it — `eval_extended` (same live infra as
`integration`, many more PRB/LLM calls), `eval_consistency`,
`eval_robustness`, and `eval_correctness_prb` (LLM only, no Keycloak/`opa`) — each invoked the same
way, e.g. `pytest eval/ -m eval_extended`. See
`docs/specs/eval/policy-eval-scenarios.md`,
`docs/specs/eval/policy-eval-robustness-consistency.md`, and
`docs/specs/eval/policy-eval-correctness-prb.md` for their
runbooks.

**Smoke test** (requires live service at `AIAC_PDP_CONFIG_URL`, default `http://127.0.0.1:7071`):

```bash
.venv/bin/python test/idp/configuration/show_keycloak_data.py
```

Exercises all `Configuration` methods — run `ls test/idp/configuration/` to see current coverage.

## Python environment

Virtual environment: `cortex/aiac/.venv`

Activate: `source cortex/aiac/.venv/bin/activate`
Run directly: `cortex/aiac/.venv/bin/python` / `cortex/aiac/.venv/bin/pytest`

Always use this venv for any Python execution, test runs, or dependency checks.

## Kubernetes & builds

Config: `k8s/`, `pyproject.toml`, `pyrightconfig.json`

Docker images: each service ships a `Dockerfile` next to its service code (build
context is `src/`, except `rag-ingest/`, which is a separate top-level
directory). Discover the current set of images and their Dockerfiles live:

```bash
find src -name Dockerfile          # per-service Dockerfiles under src/
ls rag-ingest/                     # the out-of-tree ingest image
```

Image names and build contexts are declared in the build/CI config and the
`k8s/` manifests — grep there for the authoritative name→Dockerfile mapping.

### Non-root container / volume-ownership pattern

All AIAC service images run as **non-root UID 10001**. Each service Dockerfile
adds the user before `CMD`, matching the `authbridge/sparc-service` pattern:

```dockerfile
# Drop privileges.
RUN useradd --no-create-home --uid 10001 aiac
USER 10001
```

A Dockerfile `chown` of a directory is **masked once a volume is mounted over
it** (the mounted volume, not the image layer, is what the container sees), and
the kubelet leaves emptyDir/PVC volumes root-owned by default. So any service
that writes to a mounted volume also needs pod-level `securityContext` in its
k8s manifest so the kubelet chowns the volume to the non-root user:

```yaml
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 10001
    runAsGroup: 10001
    fsGroup: 10001   # makes the mounted volume group-writable by UID 10001
```

This applies to any service that writes to a mounted volume (a PVC or an
emptyDir). Find them live by grepping the manifests for volume mounts / claims:

```bash
grep -rlniE 'volumeMounts|volumeClaimTemplates|emptyDir|persistentVolumeClaim' k8s/
```

Services that mount no volumes still need the Dockerfile `USER` directive; the
pod-level `fsGroup`/volume-chown block above is only required for those that
write to a mounted volume.

### Pod-security hardening baseline

Beyond non-root, every workload in `k8s/` and the demo manifests carries a
hardened `securityContext`. Pod level (omitted on the demo `github-agent`, whose
injected AuthBridge sidecar runs as UID 1337 — hardening there is set per
container instead so a pod-level `runAsUser` can't clobber the sidecar):

```yaml
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 10001        # 1001 for the demo github-agent
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
```

Container level, on each app container:

```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
```

With `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` the container gets a writable `/tmp`
`emptyDir` (and its real data mount — `/data`, `/rego`) so runtime temp writes
have somewhere to land. The demo `github-agent` **omits** `readOnlyRootFilesystem`
because its runtime (`uv` / `litellm` / `crewai`) writes caches under `HOME=/app`.
All core workloads also carry both readiness **and** liveness probes (`httpGet
/health` where the service exposes one; `tcpSocket` for the Controller and the
demo workloads, which don't) and CPU/memory requests + limits.
